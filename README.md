# Task
This project is the start of my portfolio website that will be used to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position.

## User Story

AS Potential Employee
I WANT a potential employer to view my deployed portfolio of work samples 

SO THAT they can review samples of my work and assess whether i am a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to showcase sample of previous work
WHEN I load my portfolio
THEN I am presented with my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about my work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled My Portfolio
WHEN I am presented with the first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
